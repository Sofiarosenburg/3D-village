#Dream Village 3D

Welcome to the repository for my 3D Village Project, created in Spline Design.
This project brings to life a small, peaceful village surrounded by nature — a cozy place with around ten charming houses, a calm lake, and a park right in the center. Every detail was carefully chosen to create harmony, warmth, and a touch of cinematic magic.

#About
The project features:
10 unique houses, each one carefully designed and positioned to make the village feel natural and balanced.
A beautiful lake that reflects the environment and adds serenity to the scene.
A small park at the heart of the village, a calm place that connects all the houses.
My dream house, created exactly the way I imagine my ideal home to be(the one with the bridge).
One special house inspired by the movie Up, bringing a colorful and nostalgic charm to the village.
There’s also a little easter egg hidden somewhere in the village! a small surprise for those who explore it carefully

#How to Explore

Move freely around the 3D scene in Spline and explore every corner of the village.
Pay attention to textures, lighting, and reflections that give each house a unique touch.
Try to find the easter egg hidden in the scene.
Don’t miss the house inspired by Up — it’s a colorful tribute among the others, standing out for its cozy and emotional design.

#Purpose
I created this project to explore the possibilities of 3D art and design in Spline.
My goal was to build a peaceful and balanced village, where every element fits together naturally.
I wanted to express creativity, imagination, and attention to detail through each choice and design.

#Process
Entirely built using Spline Design, combining structure, lighting, and depth to make the environment feel alive.
Each house was selected and adjusted to create a harmonious layout.
The lake and park were designed to add calmness and connection to the space.
The house inspired by Up was designed as a personal tribute, to add a cinematic touch to the overall project.

#Challenges
At first, it was difficult to understand how Spline worked and how each tool affected the objects.
Sometimes I made too many edits, and when it wasn’t possible to undo changes, I had to restart parts of the project.
Small details like reflections, positioning, and proportions required a lot of patience and experimentation.

#Learnings
I learned how to build, organize, and refine 3D environments with creativity and focus.
I developed a stronger sense of balance, lighting, and visual harmony.
I learned to see every challenge, even restarting, as a part of the design journey.
Most importantly, I realized that art and design are about emotion, about creating something that makes people feel connected.
