# Dream Village 3D

Welcome to the repository for my 3D Village Project, created in Spline Design.  
This project brings to life a small, peaceful village surrounded by nature — a cozy place with around ten charming houses, a calm lake, and a park right in the center. Every detail was carefully chosen to create harmony, warmth, and a touch of cinematic magic.

## About
The project features:  
- 10 unique houses, each carefully designed and positioned to make the village feel natural and balanced.  
- A beautiful lake that reflects the environment and adds serenity to the scene.  
- A small park at the heart of the village — a calm place that connects all the houses.  
- My dream house (the one with the bridge), created exactly as I imagine my ideal home.  
- One special house inspired by the movie Up, bringing a colorful and nostalgic charm to the village.  
- A little easter egg hidden somewhere in the village, a small surprise for those who explore carefully.  

## How to Explore
- Use this link to explore the scene: [Spline Project Link](https://app.spline.design/file/5b150b86-44df-4bc9-a410-62189bf9b4de)  
- Move freely around the 3D scene in Spline and explore every corner of the village.  
- Pay attention to textures, lighting, and reflections that give each house a unique touch.  
- Try to find the easter egg hidden in the scene.  
- Don’t miss the house inspired by Up — it’s a colorful tribute among the others, standing out for its cozy and emotional design.  

## Purpose
- To explore the possibilities of 3D art and design in Spline.  
- To build a peaceful and balanced village where every element fits together naturally.  
- To express creativity, imagination, and attention to detail through each choice and design.  

## Process
- Entirely built using Spline Design, combining structure, lighting, and depth to make the environment feel alive.  
- Each house was carefully selected and adjusted to create a harmonious layout.  
- The lake and park were designed to add calmness and connection to the space.  
- The house inspired by Up was designed as a personal tribute, adding a cinematic touch to the project.  

## Challenges
- At first, it was difficult to understand Spline and how each tool affected the objects.  
- Sometimes I edited too much, and when undo wasn’t enough, I had to restart parts of the project.  
- Small details like reflections, positioning, and proportions required patience and experimentation.  

## Learnings
- Learned how to build, organize, and refine 3D environments with creativity and focus.  
- Developed a stronger sense of balance, lighting, and visual harmony.  
- Realized that every challenge, even restarting, is part of the creative process.  
- Most importantly, learned that art and design are about emotion, creating spaces that make people feel connected.
